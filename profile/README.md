# Project Shadowglass Trainer — Shape the Glass, Bend the Shadow

There are games that test your reflexes, and there are games that test your patience. **Project Shadowglass** walks the line between the two, and this trainer exists as a quiet counterweight—an instrument for balance. Not to shatter the experience, but to *polish* it.

The **Project Shadowglass Trainer** is a Windows-based control layer that lets you adjust difficulty pressure, pacing, and resource flow in real time. Think of it as tuning the light that passes through fractured glass: subtle shifts, dramatic clarity.

No permanent changes. No save corruption. Just live memory adjustments that vanish the moment you detach.
